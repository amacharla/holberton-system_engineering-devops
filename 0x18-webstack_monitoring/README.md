</h4><p>Your Nginx is running on a server and its health will impact how well Nginx and other server running on it perform. A server that is overloaded with tasks that are too CPU, memory, disk or network intensive will end up not performing as expected, might just freeze and crash.</p><p>Configure Sumo Logic to monitor your servers memory, CPU, network and disk.
